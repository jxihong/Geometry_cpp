C++ Geometry Concepts
==============================

Written By: Joey Hong

This is a compilation of various geometry concepts involving vectors and 
matrices, and the implementation of their operations and algorithms. This 
project was inspired by a topcoder tutorial on geometry.

--------------------------------

The main program can be compiled by typing 'make' in the bash. There is a sample test file that can be edited.

To run the program, just type:

./geometry-test
